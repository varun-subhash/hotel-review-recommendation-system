## Project Overview
The restaurant review and recommendation system aims to provide users with a one-stop platform to discover, evaluate, and choose the best restaurants based on various criteria such as cuisine, ambiance, pricing, and hygiene. The key features include:

1. **Review System**: Allow users to write reviews, rate restaurants, and share their experiences.
2. **Recommendation Engine**: Suggest restaurants based on user preferences (e.g., family, friends, couples) and search filters (e.g., fancy, cheap, good food, authentic, aesthetic).
3. **Expense Estimation**: Provide approximate cost estimates for dining at different restaurants.
4. **Search and Filtering**: Enable users to search and filter restaurants based on various attributes.

## Technology Stack and Architecture

### Backend
- **Database**: Use a combination of the following databases:
  - **MongoDB**: For storing user reviews, restaurant information, and user preferences. MongoDB's flexible schema is well-suited for this type of unstructured data.
  - **PostgreSQL**: For storing structured data like restaurant metadata, cuisine types, location information, and pricing details.
- **API Layer**: Build a RESTful API using a framework like SpringBoot (Java) or Express.js (Node.js) to expose the necessary endpoints for the frontend.
- **Caching**: Implement a caching layer using Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data, such as restaurant listings, reviews, and recommendations.
- **Search & Filtering**: Elasticsearch (for full-text search and filtering)
- **Recommendation Engine**: Integrate a machine learning-based recommendation system, such as collaborative filtering or content-based filtering, to provide personalized restaurant suggestions.

### Frontend
- **User Interface**: Develop a modern, responsive web application using a JavaScript framework React.
- **Visualization**: Incorporate data visualization libraries like Recharts to display information such as review trends, expense estimations, and restaurant comparisons.
- **Maps and Geolocation**: Utilize a mapping API like Google Maps or Mapbox to display restaurant locations and provide distance-based recommendations.

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Deploy the backend services on a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure.
- **Database Hosting**: Use managed database services offered by the cloud providers, such as Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Azure SQL Database.
- **Caching**: Deploy the caching layer Redis on a managed service or as a standalone cluster.
- **Containerization**: Package the backend services using Docker containers for easier deployment and scalability.
- **Orchestration**: Use a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes or AWS ECS to manage the deployment and scaling of the application.

### Security and Data Privacy
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement a secure authentication system, such as OAuth 2.0 or JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to manage user access and permissions.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure sensitive data, like user reviews and restaurant details, are encrypted both at rest and in transit.
- **Compliance**: Ensure the system adheres to relevant data privacy regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA, regarding the handling and storage of user data.
